    "What is a Cursor?\n",
    "A cursor is a control structure that enables traversal over the rows of a result set. \n",
    "It acts as a pointer that points to a specific row in a result set from a database query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Do We Use Cursors?\n",
    "Row-by-Row Processing: Cursors are used when you need to process each row individually. \n",
    "This is particularly useful when the application needs to perform operations on each row of a result set, \n",
    "such as updating data, performing calculations, or applying business logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Control Over Result Sets: Cursors provide more control over the navigation of result sets. \n",
    "You can move forward and backward through the rows, fetch specific rows, and loop through the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fetching Large Result Sets: When dealing with large result sets, fetching all rows at once can be memory-intensive. \n",
    "Cursors allow fetching a few rows at a time, reducing memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Cursors Work\n",
    "Declare a Cursor: Define the cursor with the SQL query that determines the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the Cursor: Execute the query and make the result set available for processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fetch Rows: Retrieve individual rows from the result set. You can fetch one row at a time, multiple rows, or all rows depending on the application’s requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Process Rows: Perform operations on the fetched rows.\n",
